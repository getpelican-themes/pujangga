Just another Pelican site generator theme
-----------------------

The first idea for this theme come from [dbrgn blog site](http://blog.dbrgn.ch). However, some modification and change has been made to give more rich layout but still simple and minimalist. The icon on right side come from [Font Awasome](http://fontawesome.io/) and [Simple Grid](http://thisisdallas.github.io/Simple-Grid/) used to make more fluid and responsive. This theme also come with sample of [pelican config file](pelicanconf.py-sample).

To see live demo of this theme, instead of screenshot image, please visit [my official blog site](http://habibillah.kalicode.com).
